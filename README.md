# Electricity Demand Prediction using SARIMA

The energy demand importance continues to rise in parallel with the increasing population, urbanization, the spread of industry and technology. 
- When load estimations are higher than electricity demands, an excess of power supply units are activated, initiating excessive energy intake and providing unnecessary reserves. 
- Conversely, lower load forecasts may cause the system to operate in a risky region, resulting in insufficient supply. 
Forecasting power demand plays an essential role in the electric industry, as it provides the basis for making decisions in power system planning and operation. 

**The main goal of this project electricity demand time series using SARIMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) for medium term forcasts.**
